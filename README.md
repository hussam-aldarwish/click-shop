# Click-Shop E-commerce Application

[![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/hussam-aldarwish/click-shop.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/hussam-aldarwish/click-shop)

This project was built as part of a frontend development task while applying for the **Frontend Developer** position at [Eduly](https://www.eduly.com/). It demonstrates expertise in creating scalable, modular, and maintainable applications using modern technologies such as TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. It also integrates JSON-SERVER for mock API functionality.

## Features

### Authentication:

- **Registration Page**: Allows users to sign up with validation and error handling.
- **Login Page**: Enables users to log in and manage sessions securely.

### Product Listing:

- **Product Grid**: Displays a dynamic, responsive grid of products fetched from the mock API.
- **Product Details**: Provides detailed information for each product.

### Shopping Cart:

- Add products to the cart, view details, and manage quantities.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)
- **State Management**: React Context API and custom hooks
- **Mock API**: JSON-SERVER

## Package Manager Preference: pnpm

I have chosen `pnpm` as the package manager for this project due to its efficiency and performance advantages:

- Faster installations compared to npm and yarn.
- Disk space savings through content-addressable storage, avoiding redundant copies of packages.
- Strict dependency management ensures a consistent and predictable dependency tree.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14.x
- npm, pnpm, or yarn

   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Architectural Highlights

### Authentication Flow

- A modular approach is used for authentication forms, with validation schemas for input validation.

### Product Listing and State Management

- Data is fetched from the mock API and displayed dynamically.
- The application uses the Context API and hooks for managing shared states such as the shopping cart and theme.

### Best Practices

- Error handling for API requests
- Modular component design
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
